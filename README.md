1. What's the difference between git fetch and git pull?
2. git remote
3. 
4. git checkout
5. git add
6. git push
7. git pull
8. git fetch
9. git diff
10. what else??

### Adventure time
**Make your own fork!**
:fire:I used the browser then added a remote to my laptop with this:fire:
```
git remote add origin_personal https://github.com/AndrewDHill/git-basics
git remote -v
```

#### Credentials
> To store your password locally for a repo on your machine
```
git config credential.helper store
```

> TO store your password globally on your machine

```
git config --global credential.helper store

It also helps to use the .gitconfig feature so that authoring information is readily available

```
git config --global user.name "Booly Boo"
git config --global user.email "BollyBoo@googly.goo"
